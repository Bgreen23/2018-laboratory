## Programming-Phoenix
I'm working through https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix as a way to get more familiar with Phoenix.

## Drum Kit
Drum Kit was created using Wes Bos' JavaScript 30. I decided to do the drum kit because it was great ES6 practice and it also utilized HTML 5's audio tag which I had not used up until this point.

## Mouse Shadow
Mouse Shadow was another Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 project I did. I used this as a building block for another project where I wanted the same effect.
